Accessibility is about understanding the experience of a diverse range of users. One popular type of software is the *screen reader*, a program that enables visually impaired people to use computers by reading screen text aloud in a generated voice. The user can control what is read by moving the cursor to a relevant area with the keyboard.

We asked [Victor Tsaran](/web/fundamentals/accessibility/00-intro/understanding-users-diversity) to explain how, as a blind person, he accesses the web using a the built-in screen reader on OS X, called VoiceOver. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW_dUs9D1oQ" target="_blank">this video</a> of Victor using VoiceOver.

Now, it's your turn to try using a screen reader. Here is a page with *ChromeVox Lite*, a minimal but functioning screen reader written in Javascript. The screen is purposefully blurred to simulate a low-vision experience and force the user to complete the task with a screen reader. Of course, you'll need to use the Chrome browser for this exercise.

You can use the control panel at the bottom of the screen to control the screen reader. This screen reader has very minimal functionality, but you can explore the content using the `Previous` and `Next` buttons, and you can click things using the `Click` button.

Try using this page with ChromeVox lite enabled to get a feel for screen reader use. Come back when you're done and we'll continue the guide.
